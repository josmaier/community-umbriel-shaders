# Witching Hour

A ragged portal burns through the entire outgoing scene, revealing the next one
in place, including wallpaper, windows, decorations and shell surfaces.
Pumpkin-orange fire, yellow-hot edges, patches of witch-green flame
and a violet smoky halo travel outward from an off-centre ignition point.
The ignition point follows the workspace navigation axis and direction.

The previews are real headless compositor captures of two populated workspaces
with synthetic wallpaper and a panel. One shader blends the two complete scenes,
so the flame edge continues across windows, wallpaper and shell surfaces.
The cursor and output postprocessing remain after the transition. When both
workspaces share a wallpaper, the image stays the same on either side of the
portal, but the fire and smoke still travel across it.

## Use

Save [effect.toml](effect.toml) and [shader.glsl](shader.glsl) together under
`~/.config/umbriel/shaders/community/animation/witching-hour/`, keeping the
[license](../../LICENSES/Barrulus-MIT.txt). Merge [config.toml](config.toml)
into your Umbriel configuration:

```toml
[include]
files = ["shaders/community/animation/witching-hour/effect.toml"]

[animation]
enabled = true

[animation.workspaces]
enabled = true
style = "reveal"
effect = "witching-hour"
duration_ms = 1100
curve = "linear"
```

Append to existing include lists and merge existing tables. Including the
preset registers it; the workspace selection enables it. **`style = "reveal"`
is required.** This is a workspace transition, not a window opening effect.

## Configuration options

Try `duration_ms = 800` for a quicker switch or `1400` to linger over the flames.
Keep `curve = "linear"` for the intended timing; the shader eases the portal
radius internally. Eased progress drives both the mask and flames so a reversed
swipe retraces the effect. Spring curves determine their own duration.

Edit these constants in [shader.glsl](shader.glsl):

| Constant | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FIRE_WIDTH` | `0.035` | Flame width as a fraction of the shorter output dimension; try `0.02`–`0.06`. |
| `RAGGEDNESS` | `0.045` | Irregularity of the portal edge in the same units; try `0.02`–`0.08`. |
| `INTENSITY` | `1.0` | Flame and smoke strength, clamped to `0`–`1`; zero keeps the reveal mask. |

The preset uses fixed Halloween colours and does not read the theme palette.
Restore `style = "slide"` and clear `effect = ""` to return to native sliding.

## Compatibility and cost

Requires the new [workspace reveal API](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/umbriel/blob/main/docs/user/animation.md#workspace-reveal),
including `umbriel_sample_incoming` and `umbriel_workspace_axis`. Tested with
**Umbriel 0.1.0 (`2145668`)**. Older builds that reveal individual workspace
trees are incompatible. Output-wide UVs address both scene textures; exact
endpoints return the outgoing scene at zero and the incoming scene at one.

Two scene texture samples and four bounded procedural-noise evaluations per
fragment; no previous-frame feedback or texture assets. Reveal rendering also
has compositor capture costs. Hardware performance and HDR are not benchmarked.

Validation includes GLES endpoint, alpha and four-axis checks, plus headless
empty-to-empty switches, populated scenes with wallpaper and a panel, both
switch directions and swipe cancellation. See the
[validation record](../../VALIDATION.md#witching-hour-full-scene-reveal-2026-10-10).
